## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### Quick Testing:
```bash
# Test with fast small dataset
python test_framework.py  # Uses automatic dataset detection

# Manual testing with specific dataset
from rst_trap_finder.core import WordAssociationGraph
graph = WordAssociationGraph.from_csv("data/reduced/reduced_rst_dataset_[timestamp].csv")
top_words = graph.rank_words(top_k=10)
```

### Research Analysis:
```bash
# Use complete dataset for research
graph = WordAssociationGraph.from_csv("data/merged/complete_rst_dataset.csv")
# Full 35K words, 143K edges - research quality
```
